# Destruct Class

At my geophysical testing lab there is a materials test that determines the weld strengths of geomembranes. Geomembranes are 
used in the field as liners for engineering projects to prevent contamination of the surrounding environment. The lab tests 
membrane welds by using a mechanical device to stretch test samples and determine the strength at which
they break and how they do so. 

The two types of welds are named fusion and extrusion. Each type of weld has both peel and shear tests, corresponding to
the way they are pulled apart.

I wrote a class that concatenates Excel data and provides quick summaries of average strengths and break types for 
large amounts of data that extend over dozens of Excel sheets.
